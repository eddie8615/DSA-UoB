`java-skeleton` is a skeleton folder for a java project. When starting a new java project you should do a full copy of this directory:
```shell
cp -r java-skeleton ~/.../myProjectFolder/myJavaProject
```
It contains
* an appropriate structure for your java source and test code
* a suitable `.gitignore' file to control the files that GIT considers when you save your project to a repository,
* a Java format style and a short-cut templates file for use in Eclipse
* a default log4j.properties file for configuring the log4j logging library
